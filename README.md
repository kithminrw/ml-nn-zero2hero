# Collection of notes on {ml.nn-zero2hero}

### Disclaimer: All the rights of these codes and resources belong to their original authors. I am compiling a collection for self-learning purposes and to build tools by myself using the knowledge.

I learned how to build these notes like this thanks to the source repository for the [Hands-On Mathematical Optimization with Python](https://github.com/mobook/MO-book) and the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/build.html) page on how to build beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational content.
