<!--# Collection of notes on {ml.nn-zero2hero}-->
### Disclaimer: All the rights of these codes and resources belong to their original authors. I am compiling a collection for self-learning purposes and to build tools by myself using the knowledge.

My notes and learnings following the [nn_zero_to_hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) guide by Andrej Karpathy and the open-source notebooks available on [Hands-On Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Python using Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow 2](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3) by Aurelien Geron. Personally, I found these to be two of the best resources available on this subject, purely from an applied learning stand point. I should also look into getting a better theoretical background on the subject as well. I learned how to build these notes like this thanks to [](https://github.com/mobook/MO-book)
