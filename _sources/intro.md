 I am compiling a collection for self-learning purposes and to build tools by myself using the knowledge.

Welcome to **Collection of notes on {ml.nn-zero2hero}**. This repository includes notes and learnings following the Youtube Playlist on [nn_zero_to_hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) guide by Andrej Karpathy and the open-source notebooks available from the book on [Hands-On Machine Learning and Deep Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781098125967/) by Aurelien Geron. Personally, I found these to be two of the best resources available on this subject, purely from an applied learning stand point. For great visual understanding, the videos on the Youtube Channel [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) are quite helpful as well.

Other resources include (but not limited to),
- The [DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai/) courses on the Machine Learning / Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng
- Online book on [Model-based Machine Learning](https://mbmlbook.com/) by John Winn
- [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf) by Christopher Bishop
- [Hands-On Mathematical Optimization with Python](https://github.com/mobook/MO-book) by The MO Book Group

```{note}
The goals of this collection of notebooks are to:

* Grasp the foundations for hands-on machine learning and deep learning in an elegant approach
* Have fun while learning and compiling notes and eventually end in a culmination of work
* Help readers to easily navigate the learning experience with a good compilation on notes on the subject
* Demonstrate the use of SOTA tools and concepts for documenting beautiful publication-quality work
```
