# Collection of notes on {ml-nn-zero2hero}

Welcome to this repository of Collection of notes on {ml.nn-zero2hero}. This repository includes notes and learnings following the [nn_zero_to_hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) guide by Andrej Karpathy and the open-source notebooks available on [Hands-On Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Python using Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow 2](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3) by Aurelien Geron. Personally, I found these to be two of the best resources available on this subject, purely from an applied learning stand point. I should also look into getting a better theoretical background on the subject as well. 

Other resources include (but not limited to),
- The [DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai/) courses on the Machine Learning / Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng
- Online book on [Model-based Machine Learning](https://mbmlbook.com/) by John Winn
- [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf) by Christopher Bishop

The goals of these notebooks are to:

* Provide a foundation for hands-on learning of mathematical optimization,
* Demonstrate the tools and concepts of optimization with practical examples,
* Help readers to develop the practical skills needed to build models and solving problem using state-of-the-art modeling languages and solvers.
